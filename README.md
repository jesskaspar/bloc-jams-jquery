# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app
This project allowed me to practice with jQuery and JavaScript - seeing the difference in the two and how to use them both.
This music player allows the user to listen to a few different songs, pause, skip, skip-back, and change the volume.
